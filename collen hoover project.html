            <p class="paragraph">Colleen Hoover (born December 11, 1979, Sulphur Springs, Texas, U.S.) is an American author who became a
                publishing phenomenon in the early 21st century and is known for hugely popular books that typically
                feature romance and dramatic plot twists. Forgoing more traditional marketing plans, Hoover
                self-published many of her books, which became sensations on social media, especially TikTok.

                Early life and family
                Hoover grew up in Texas. Her father was physically abusive to her mother, and the couple divorced while
                she was a toddler. Her mother later married, and the family struggled financially while running a small
                dairy farm. Hoover attended Texas A&M–Commerce, where she earned a degree in social work in 2004. She
                held various jobs before becoming a counselor for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
                Infants, and Children, a federal program. During this time she lived in a trailer home with her husband,
                who was a long-haul trucker, and their three children.

                First novels
                Using a borrowed laptop, Hoover began writing the romance novel Slammed in 2011. It was originally
                intended as a Christmas gift to her mother, and Hoover self-published the work in 2012. Although
                initially rejected by publishers, it began climbing best-seller lists, aided by word of mouth and
                enthusiastic reviews on social media platforms. The novel centers on an 18-year-old woman who moves to
                Michigan with her family after the death of her father. Once there, she becomes romantically involved
                with her neighbour, but a startling discovery forces them apart. Things are further complicated by
                another family tragedy. Readers embraced the romance, drama, and surprising plot turns, all of which
                became hallmarks of Hoover’s works. The sequels, Point of Retreat (2012) and This Girl (2013), also
                became bestsellers.
